**My Experience with Unity and C#** <br>

Here you can watch my experience of makeing this project which will be also part of the presentation.

**Figma UX/UI and Research plan** <br>

Here you can see my research plan as well as UX/UI and the prototype of the video game.

**Live version of the game** <br>

Here you can try out the game for yourself! <br>
**CONTROLS** <br>
W = Forward <br>
S = Backwards <br>
A = Left <br>
D = Right <br>
SHIFT = Roll <br>
SHIFT(HOLD) = SPRINT <br>
E = Light Attack <br>
R = Heavy Attack <br>
P.S When I uplaoded the game to itch.io there seems to be a bug with falling where the character is falling very slowly which I didn't have time to fix, this is not the case in the Unity as you can see in the video.

**ORGANIZATION** <br>
Here is the trello board which I used to organize myself, it's not super detiled but it helped me a lot! <br>
I also Used Google Calendar for better organization.
